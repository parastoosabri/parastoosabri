## Hi there 👋

Currently based in the Central European Time zone 🌍. I’m a strong believer in smart task coordination and finding practical solutions at the right moment. Whether working on-site or remotely, I value teamwork and aim to contribute meaningfully to any team or society I’m part of.

I’m a lifelong learner who enjoys staying updated in today’s fast-moving tech landscape — especially in digital operations and global collaboration👩🏻‍💻.

When I’m not working on building my future and dreams, you’ll likely find me watching movies, enjoying a good cup of coffee, or relaxing by a river or in a forest. I’m also a fan of staying active, catching a new gym is part of the adventure 🌱.
